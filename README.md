Welcome to the Non-Code Hacktoberfest 2023 project! We're excited to have you here. While Hacktoberfest is traditionally associated with coding, we believe that contributions go beyond just writing code. This project is all about making a meaningful impact in non-technical ways.

## What is Non-Code Hacktoberfest?

Non-Code Hacktoberfest is an opportunity for people who want to contribute to open source projects but don't code. Here, you can help with documentation, design, community building, and more. We appreciate your efforts in making the open-source community even better.
